This has an interesting concept where you play through the same storyline multiple times to make different choices and see all the outcomes. Unfortunately you're going through the same 6ish areas and fighting the same enemies over and over again, and you're unable to skip any of the cutscenes for any repeated choices. It becomes way too much of a slog to see everything. I bailed after doing just enough to see the "true" ending and that was enough for me.
