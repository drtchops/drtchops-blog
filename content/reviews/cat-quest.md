Game is cute but I wish it had more going for it. It's just not very deep and makes up for it with fetch quests and copy paste dungeons. Also the story just kinda ends and nothing gets resolved. Also there's an island where the devs put themselves on it and it's meta jerkoff bullshit and I hate it. Not bad for a day playthrough though.
