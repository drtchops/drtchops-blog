Played this since it was made by the Spiritfarer devs. It's alright, interesting enough little metroidvania with some randomization that looks great and plays pretty well. The only annoying thing is it lets you run around until it decides you've gone far enough and then summons like 10 billion enemies to kill you. Gets pretty tedious.

3/5
