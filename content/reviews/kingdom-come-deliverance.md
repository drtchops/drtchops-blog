I really wanted to like this game. It clearly had a lot of heart poured into it. It's just... too damn janky. I played for awhile, dealing with all the bugs and stupid combat because it was a nice game with an interesting story and open world. But it just kept getting worse with each patch as they broke more things and made stuff worse. I'm pretty disappointed in this one.

2/5
