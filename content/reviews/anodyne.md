I thought I had played through this ages ago, but I hadn't. This is a weird game, but neat. The writing is interesting but due to (by their own admission) the devs' inexperience it just comes off as confusing. It's funny to see how the went from this to Even the Ocean and did a 180 and made everything as blunt as possible.

3/5
