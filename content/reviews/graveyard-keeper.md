This is basically a much less polished, deep, or interesting Stardew. The slow grind in this game is insane, it takes forever to make any progress. I didn't mind it too much when playing since I wanted something comfy but by the end I was so sick of it and got real mad at the complete lack of payoff in the ending.

2/5
