I played the non-D&D branded precursor to this game and it felt pretty meh. I'm not sure if it's all the polish they've done to this version or just the familiarity of D&D but this game feels a lot nicer. The formation mechanics are very interesting and make this game worth playing despite it being pretty shallow otherwise for an idle game.

3/5
