Strange little game where you play rock paper scissors except you can influence it to make it less random. Game was just average but it had a bunch of themes about office politics and work/life balance that were way too relatable right at the time I was playing it and it kinda hit me hard mentally. It doesn't have much going for it really, I just happened to play it at the perfect time for myself personally.
