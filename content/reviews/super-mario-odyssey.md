I ended up getting a switch when this game out so I could play this and the above two games. Amazon sent me two copies of this instead of one of this and one of zelda so I had to play this one first and it was... ok. It was a perfectly acceptable video game that I played through. It just... didn't do anything special, and most of the things (moons) in the game were kinda boring and not rewarding. I don't really understand why people said this was a masterpiece because it doesn't do anything particularly interesting ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯

2/5
