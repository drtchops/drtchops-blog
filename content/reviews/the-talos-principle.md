Started this one near the end of the year since other people were talking about it. I did like how the puzzles in this were balanced. The mechanics were all pretty simple and easy to figure out without being walked through everything. Nothing was frustratingly hard and everything needed at least some thought. I did get annoyed by the time based ending section and I found the stars too tedious to collect, but otherwise a good puzzle game.

4/5
