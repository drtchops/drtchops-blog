I played this at a friend's house while drunk and it was a wonderful time. I would've completely hated this if I was sober and alone. I don't understand why these CHOICES MATTERRRRR games are so focused on showing off how _deep_ and _intelligent_ they are by showing you exactly which choices actually do anything and what the result was. It destroys any sense of immersion and actually makes you feel like you're just following predetermined paths instead of actually making your own story. But anyway while drunk with friends it was hella fun to purposely fail QTEs and get everyone killed.
