This has got to be the most phoned-in game I've ever played. It feels like there wasn't a single original thought during all of development. It was just "hey what if we made banjo kazooie again?" and then that was literally it. Even the writing calls out how unoriginal it is. An immensely uninteresting game.

1/5
