I snuck this one in right at the end of 2017 and I'm very glad I did. There's not much gameplay going on here but the writing is absolutely fantastic. Some of the most real and relatable characters I've seen in gaming. I actually kinda feel like the whole mystery thing in the last half kind of took away from the game and I wish they kept it centered around normal people's lives, but they still got a lot of value out of it. Definitely a must play if you have any emotions at all.

5/5
