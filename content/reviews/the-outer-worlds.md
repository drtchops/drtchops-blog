Fantastic. It doesn't do anything particularly new or inventive, but it's a very solid and well put together sci-fi FPS RPG. The story peters out a little near the end and I wish some of the characters were a bit more fleshed out but otherwise it's just a joy to play through start to finish. The writing and character interactions especially are incredibly good.

4/5
