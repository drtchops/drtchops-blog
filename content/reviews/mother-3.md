Earthbound was a very good game that meant a lot to me as a kid. This game, however, is a pretty bad game. The art and music are good, and some of the writing is good, but it seems like most of the game is just HEY WASN'T EARTHBOUND WACKY??? LOOK HOW WACKY EVERYTHING IS!!!! The plot kinda meanders along for awhile until it literally dumps all over you halfway through. And the gameplay, good god the gameplay. All the RPG mechanics seemed very poorly designed and not balanced even slightly. There's a ton of incredibly stupid things in the game that do nothing except annoy the player (FUCK feeling feverish). Most of my enjoyment from this game was naming characters after speedfriends and streaming it. The game itself was Not Good.

2/5
