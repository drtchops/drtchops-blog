Dishonored 2 was a pretty big let down for me. I went into this game with pretty low expectations, and it turned out ok. Other than the last mission which was shit, the levels were fairly interesting and fun to play through. The story was fine, the lack of a chaos system was preferred honestly. I probably enjoyed playing through this more than 2 just because it was shorter and didn't perform like complete ass.

3/5
