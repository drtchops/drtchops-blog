This was mostly the game I wanted a switch for, and goddamn was it worth it. This game is absolutely not without its flaws, but the core gameplay and sense of exploration by far made up for those. It didn't really have huge standout moments or anything, but it was consistently fun and interesting to fuck around in the world throughout. It was also actually fresh and interesting for a Zelda game, something that was sorely lacking in Odyssey. I like, was actually interested in the characters and wished they had done more with them! Though the boss fights were still extremely boring, I wish they had moved on from those too.

5/5
