This game was really cool! Neat little time travel murder mystery game where you need to use logic to deduce what happened to everyone on the ship. It was a lot of fun to figure it all out, but it did have some problems. Occasionally there's less deducing and more "well these names match somehow to these faces, I'm just gunna try all combinations until it says it's right." There's also this annoying smoke thing that it forces you to watch that leads you to a thing you were literally just looking at which gets really annoying. Overall very good but not the amazing 10/10 game people were making it out to be.

4/5
