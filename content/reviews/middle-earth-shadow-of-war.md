I honestly didn't get all that far in this. It just doesn't seem to do much to build on the first game and I had enough of that after the 20ish hours the first time. The orc captain dudes are just way too frequent and they keep interrupting whatever you're doing and there's no way to skip their intro shit talk and it's just too frustrating. I might come back and play through this in a year or two maybe.
