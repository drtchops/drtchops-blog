Everyone seemed to absolutely love this game and I don't get it? Like, it's fine, it was a solid generic 6.5/10 open world game, but there's a million of those. Combat was bad and the movement was fun if you were going in a straight line down a street, but horrible if you wanted to maneuver at all. Writing was pretty ok but there's just not much that puts this above the million other open world games these days.

3/5
