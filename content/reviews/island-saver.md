This game is an enigma. It's about cleaning up litter, but also it was funded by a bank so it's got a bunch of bank-related mechanics to it? It like, tries to teach you that saving money at the bank is good but the interest you get is so hilariously pitiful that I'm not sure if the devs were secretly making fun of capitalism? I think my playthrough was fueled by confusion

2/5
