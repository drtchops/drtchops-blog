This game was odd in that there were a million things that frustrated me (I REALLY wanna know why they decided to have 2 separate fast travel systems) yet I really enjoyed my time with it and kept wanting to go back. I did get pretty tired of it near the end and I wish the whole last act had been cut, but I still very much recommend the game. The brush mechanics were actually a lot of fun!

3/5
