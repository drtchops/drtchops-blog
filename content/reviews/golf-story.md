U N B O U N D. This was another game I was really interested in getting a switch for since it seemed along the same comfy lines as Stardew Valley. While it turned out to not quite reach that extremely high bar, it was still a really comfy enjoyable game. The biggest problem with it is golf just isn't that fun, and it doesn't really get any more fun or interesting as the game goes on. The writing and presentation carried this game really hard. I do still need to finish this off, though.
