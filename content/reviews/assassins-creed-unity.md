I tried this one as I heard that other than the bugs it was a solid entry into the series. Well, it wasn't great. The parkour was as clunky and frustrating as ever. The story was pretty terrible and I had zero reason to care about any of the characters (they kill off the MC's dad like 10min into the game, then kill off his foster dad like 20min later, but I don't CARE about this person). The present day plot ends with literally nothing you did mattering, making the plot entirely superfluous, much like this series. Usually in open world games I shut off my brain and do all or most of the side stuff, but here I did next to none since I just cared so little about this game.

2/5
