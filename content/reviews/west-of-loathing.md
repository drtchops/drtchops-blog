This game is kind of pure nostalgia fuel from my time playing Kingdom of Loathing literally 10 years ago. It ended up being a pretty solid enjoyable weekend or two, but didn't leave all that much of an impression on me (I originally forgot to add it to this pastebin). Pretty funny, simple gameplay, good way to spend time.

3/5
