This game's atmosphere and writing is very good but holy shit is it a slog. Doing anything just takes so fucking long and when you die you have start over almost from scratch. I wanted to play more to dive into more of the lore but when playing it I spent more time staring at my phone than at the game and that's just not a good look.

2/5
