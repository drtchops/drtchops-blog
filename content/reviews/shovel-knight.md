Don't really understand why this game is so popular. I mean, it's alright, the art and music are great, but the gameplay's just not that fun. In particular, fuck instant death pits and spikes. What the fuck is the point of having a health bar when 90% of the stuff in the game will kill you in one hit? It makes for incredibly unfun level design and removes any of the satisfaction from getting through them.

2/5
