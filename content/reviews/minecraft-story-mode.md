So after I played Harvester for last new years, I needed something equally as horrifying to follow it up, and I decided to play this. It was... quite an experience. The writing is fucking horrible, the QTEs don't actually do anything 90% of the time, the pacing is stupid, the choices are pointless, there's an entire episode dedicated to youtube lets players jerking themselves off. I fuckin loved playing through it, made for such a fun goddamn couple streams.
