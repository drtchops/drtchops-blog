This was an interesting little game that tries to play around with the player's relationship with the characters. It has some gimicky outside of game gameplay elements that are kinda hit and miss. I didn't think too well of the game after I "finished" it, but then found out there's a secondary playthrough. That playthrough did a much better job exploring the ideas and building the emotions it wanted. An interesting experience to go through, even if it's not the most compelling actual game.
