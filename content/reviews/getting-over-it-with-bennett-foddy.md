So this is a game that is meant to be frustrating. You're supposed to feel the pain of starting over, over and over again, in order to make the triumph of succeeding mean so much more. Or something. It thinks so highly of itself, but really it's just a bad game with poor controls and annoying level design. You should never make your game difficult by making the player have to fight against the controls to make it do what they want. That doesn't make the game challenging, it makes it _bad_.
