It really feels like the quality has tanked with this series. There's just nothing creative or interesting being added now and the climbing feels significantly worse? There were multiple times where a popup tells you exactly which buttons to press to proceed and I press them and it doesn't work and you fall to your death and have to redo a bunch of climbing. Perhaps fortunately it felt a lot shorter than previous installments too.

2/5
