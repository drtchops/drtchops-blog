A decent game, very impressive work by a solo dev. It was a lot more linear and story based than I was expected (it looked and felt like a metroidvania at first). It could definitely do with a UX consultant as there's a lot of things and interactions that didn't feel intuitive. Lore was interesting but it does not gracefully immerse you into it in the slightest, just kinda throws new concepts and worldbuilding without actually answering most questions.

3/5
