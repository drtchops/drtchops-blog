A decently enjoyable game. The concept of there being only a small number of fleshed out NPCs that you can talk to or kill is pretty neat. The combat's not too great though, and the difficulty spikes oddly (2ndish last boss was real hard but last one is a cakewalk). It overstays its welcome a bit with a dumb fetch quest near the end too. Also not a fan of the good ending being tied to difficulty.

3/5
