I just wanted a dumb mindless shooty game to distract me for a couple days and that's what I got. I played on easy and blew through everything which I'm sure was a very good idea because the gameplay was pretty repetitive and boring. The writing was completely awful but the voice acting was pretty decent. It had some of the worst facial animations I've seen, which was fun. Honestly not the worst game I've played through.

2/5
