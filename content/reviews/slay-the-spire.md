Holy crap an early access game that actually feels like a complete polished experience and is a good game!!! I was afraid of getting into this because I knew so many others had been sucked in and with good reason. All the deckbuilding fun without any of those annoying other people the muck up the experience. I dumped a good bit of time into this before getting burned out and I'll probably get back into it when it properly releases.

4/5
