This was an incredibly interesting experience. It handled its representation of psychosis really well and gives it a super cool manifestation in game form. But it's also just... not a very good game. The combat is extremely tedious and uninteresting and there is FAR too much of it. The puzzles are neat at first but too simple and straight forward. You end up spending far more time just waiting for the character to run between things than actually solving the puzzle. I really liked what this game did well but I just... wish it tried to be less of a game, tbh. Less combat and deeper puzzles would've made it a lot more enjoyable.

4/5
