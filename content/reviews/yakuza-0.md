I went into this game expecting to not like it very much and ho boy was I wrong. I've never seen a game that manages to balance serious and silly tones as well as this one. I absolutely loved the storyline and all the extra substories in this. The minigames were a mix, while they were all at least entertaining the first time, some became a big chore after a couple plays. I didn't really care for the combat too much as I expected, it was pretty repetitive and not very difficult since you could pause and heal at any time, it just loved wasting your time with enemies blocking forever or stun locking you. Still, despite that, it's one of my favourite games I've played recently.

5/5
