I don't particularly like 2D platformers so this is an interesting one for me. It is clearly extremely polished and plays very well. The art and music is fantastic and the writing is absolutely exceptional. Definitely almost made me cry on my flights to and from Iceland. But like, I just didn't really have fun playing it. I wish it wasn't illegal for and indie game to be something other than a 2D platformer.
