DOS was one of my favourite games ever made and this one is more of that, with a bunch of nice QoL improvements. Its combination of slick tactical RPG and co-op gameplay is pretty unique and I'd love to have more games like it. It's pretty much as close to D&D as you can get in gaming and I HECKING LOVE D&D. Absolutely recommended 10/10. I want to try out the GM mode, I should plan to do some of that next year :eyes:

5/5
