This game is BAD. Extremely bad. But it was also extremely entertaining. Playing through this on stream while drinking was one of the all-time highlights of my stream. Ridiculously campy acting and writing, and the puzzles were super stupid. But it was still hella fun. If you play this, bring a guide, and preferrably bring an audience.
