The little indie game that could. No, not cuphead, fuck that game. Hollow Knight did so many things well. It also did a ton of things very badly, but I still think it's a very good game, so you know the things it did well it did super well. The setting, atmosphere, and art direction are excellent, and the gameplay is very well done. It satisfied the metroidvania shaped hole in my heart that Ori left, and it even had bosses that I enjoyed, which is very rare. Easily my indie game of the year.

4/5
