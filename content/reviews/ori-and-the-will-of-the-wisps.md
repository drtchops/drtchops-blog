I started out not really feeling this, but ended up getting more into it by the end. This game feels more Hollow Knight inspired than Ori 1, and that suits me better because I like that game more. Overall a better game than Ori 1, but I couldn't help but feel this game tried to do too much and suffered for it.

4/5
