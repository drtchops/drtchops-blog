Considering this was an FPSRPG made by Arkane and styled after System Shock 2, you'd think this would be my fuckin JAM. Turns out this was the most overwhelmingly ok video game ever made. It did some things right, did some things wrong, was enjoyable enough to play through, but didn't really evoke much of a response at all really? That seemed to be by far the most common opinion on this game, it was just "ok". Good enough way to spend time but otherwise eh.

3/5
