Ok, so, like, I actually really liked this game. Wait no don't leave please hear me out! First of all, the environmental designs in this game were actually super beautiful (not surprising it was the only team that knew wtf they were doing throughout development). Other than that, the game is really entertaining if you treat it like a parody of Mass Effect or just sci-fi in general. The really goofy dialog, the shitty animations, the campy aliens, all of it is just such good fun when you take it lightheartedly. It made me really really really want a proper sci-fi RPG parody, like a Galaxy Quest but with Mass Effect mechanics. That'd be fuckin awsome.

3/5
