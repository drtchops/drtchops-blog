I played this shortly after it came out so I didn't have to worry about spoilers. This is a very nice upgrade over Undertale (seriously go back and play it, it feels so damn janky now). It was a nice length for a demo and the writing and art were very good throughout. I'm very interested in seeing the rest of the game but who knows if that'll ever actually come out. Also the secret boss is complete shit and unfun.

4/5
