When I originally saw a preview for this I was worried the gameplay wouldn't really work in 3D. Then suddenly it was out and it turns out it's even more fun than the original! It's a nice fun shooter both alone and with friends. It's in early access still and I'm worried about the lack of content or originality (it's literally just a port of RoR1 to 3D) but I faith the devs will build up on it well, as so far patches have been directly addressing feedback.

3/5
