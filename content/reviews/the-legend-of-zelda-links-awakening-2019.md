I think I would've hated this had I not played the original when I was a kid. The graphics updates are very pretty and there's a couple of nice QoL updates but the game design is still very outdated and frustrating, especially when it comes to figuring out where to go and actually getting there. I think all the future handheld Zeldas improved on this one a ton. I don't think this is worth it unless you're really craving more Zelda.

2/5
