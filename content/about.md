I'm not a very nostalgic person and even big emotional moments kinda get lost after really short amounts of time for me. Included in this is the video games I play through. Even ones I super enjoy and have a huge investment into I just kinda forget I even played a couple months later. It makes making a GOTY pick or retrospective really hecking hard as I can't really remember what games I even played during the year. To remedy this, I'm going to start writing short reviews to hopefully help me remember the good times and the bad, and remember the lessons I learned along the way to help inform and guide me if I ever end up making games of my own.

I'm going to start rating these out of 5 to indicate how much of a recommendation each is:

1. don't bother
2. not great, rough but worthwhile parts if you want to dig
3. decent, worth checking out if you like the genre / style
4. very good, you'll probably find this worth playing
5. please play this
